The HANDOFF MANAGER will help you organize your handoffs across specific cost codes.

With it, you can:

 * Create COST CODES and customize the billing unit (HOURS or WORDS) and billing unit price.
 * Within COST CODES, create TASKS and specify the DEADLINE DATE, DEADLINE TIME, and volume according to the cost code's billing unit.

Features include:

* Date Range Filter: Allows you to filter tasks by their deadline date.
* Dynamic Counter: Displays the number of completed tasks, total tasks, and total cost codes, based on the filtered date range.
* Dynamic Pricing: Automatically updates the price when the cost code's billing price is changed.
* Safe Deleting: Prevents the deletion of a task until it is completed and prohibits the deletion of a cost code until it has no remaining tasks.
* Search Functionality: Enables quick keyword searches for tasks in the dashboard.
